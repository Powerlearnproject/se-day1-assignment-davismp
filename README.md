Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
this is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems that help run software products smoothely and efficiently.
this profession is important and crucial in the tech industries because it allows software engineers to design, develop, test and deploy software systems and applications that poer and run different aspects of the modern tech era. these aspects include communication, healthcare, entertainment, commerce among many others.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development and advent of high-level software engineering programming languages such as fortran language, C programming language among others; this occured in the 1950s and 1960s.
advent of structured programming languages and establishment of software engineering; this milestone was achieved in the 1960s and 1970s and marked the origin of clearer progamming codes and languages with well organization.
the rise of agile methodoligies in software engineering; this key milestone occured in the 2000s whereby software engineeering and programming languages evolved. this made software engineering more iterative, more adaptive and flexible under programming language.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requiremnets; involves planning, collecting, gathering and documenting system requirements and user needs to develop a software system that meet user needs.
design; involves outlining and creating software achitecture systems and high-level languages, user models and interfaces.
implementation; this involves coding following the different specifications and user needs into a software program and product.
testing; this stage involves identifying and fixing variuos functional aspects and needs of the software to ensure quality functionality and standards.
deployment; once the system features and attributes are tested, the system is then released to customers and end users.
maintainance; this is the last phase that involves updating and supporting the software system to remain sustainable, functional and efficient to the users after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
